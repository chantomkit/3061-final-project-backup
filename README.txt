Just a backup for my code in the simulation
Brief description of the project:
1. Initialize a cubic chamber with Maxwellian ideal gases
2. After the transient state, turn on an oscillator at one side
3. After another transient state, start measure different quantities of the gases (total velocity, force on wall, energy... etc)
4. Analyse the quantities which indicates wave-like behavior by DFT, as to reduce the noise and find the true frequency
5. Compare the true frequency with the pre-defined frequency of the oscillator
